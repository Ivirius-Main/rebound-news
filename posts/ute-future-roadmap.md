So I was just thinking about how UltraTextEdit (one of my many apps) would work in the future. In fact, there are more than 10 distinct variants of UTE!
They are:
- **UltraTextEdit WPF (2021, and again, 2024-)**, which is included as a part of jpb Office and written in WPF
- UltraTextEdit Pro/UltraTextEdit UWP S (2021, and again, 2023), the precursor to UTE UWP 21H2/22H1's codebase
- **UTE UWP (old codebase) (2021-)**, UTE UWP versions 21H2 and 22H1. This codebase still receives new features and reglar montly updates!
- **UTE UWP (new/TowPad-based codebase) (2022-)**, UTE UWP versions 22H2-24H2. This codebase still receives new features and monthly updates, as well as Dev Channel flights and major feature updates.
- UTE WASDK v1 (2022-2023), UTE rewritten in the Windows App SDK. The last release was in February 2023 and it has since been abandoned, deprecated and replaced with UTE WASDK V2.
- **UTE WASDK v2 (2023-)**, my second, and successful, attempt at rewriting UTE in the Windows App SDK. Updates are irregularly released, but an update will come soon (April at the latest).
- **UTE UWP+ (UltraTextEdit UWP Plus) (2023-)**, this is basically UTE UWP but after a development reset (new codebase, underived from TowPad). It will contain many new features on top of standard UTE UWP 24H2, and get the same monthly updates pledge as the regular UTE UWP. It gets a new Dev flight at least once a month.

**Bold** codebases are ones that are currently maintained in any way.

## Future Plans
Because I have so many different versions of UTE, it is a really hard project to maintain overall. However, I'm thinking of creating a regular update schedule so that it will be easier to maintain and keep all my pladges.
Here is my plan:
- To use the "Patch Tuesday" updates pledge for any stable UTE UWP/UTE UWP+ build (this was first implemented on February 8, 2022 and has been continuing ever since)
- To offer monthly updates to every jpb Office app (this includes UTE WPF)
- To offer at least one new Dev flight monthly to UTE UWP+ users
- And finally, to offer monthly patches for UTE WASDK v2, so it does not get forgotten just like v1 was

## Conclusion
In conclusion, I am going to keep up my current pladges for the apps, and introduce some new ones so an "Sorry, I forgot about the app :/" scenario doesn't happen
There are also many other apps/services that I have given update pledges to, such as the rest of jpb Office, Windivs, and jpbROM (which all have monthly update pledges for a stable release), so the strategies described in this article may eventually come to bind them as well.
